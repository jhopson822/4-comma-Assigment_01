*Figure 1. This is my 4-comma, explain what this 4-comma is trying to encaptulate.* *Ensure your image is high-definition, with a width greater than 3500 pixels. If your imafe is not wide enough, it will not fill the page!*

<!-- Abstract -->
## Abstract
This project is a critique of attitudes that value art only as a method of making money and disregard the work and experience needed to create notable art. I highlight the ways that AI steals art through its training data and ignores ownership by recreating copyrighted characters through prompt engineering.

Your Introduction and Related Works here: 200 words here.

Here I talk about how these works have paved the way for my project. Recent research shows that sense of belonging is evoked when using mixed realty [1], and my work is inspired by this xyz. Another recent project examines the beauty of symmetry in evolution [2] that my work highlights in my 4-comma cell number 4.
Notable work by Kamp in 2019, highlights the beauty that could be found in nature and how it connects to design [3] and my work show the influence of that visual in 4-comma cell number 3.


## Methodology
